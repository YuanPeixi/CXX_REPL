# CXX_REPL
A REPL like CXX Console (However it actually use clang to compile instead of JIT or working as an explainer)
Well, since it require a entire MinGW toolchain, I would not upload all the folder.
Instead, they are packed into zipped file and upload necessary parts
# Note
## Just for use
- Download *REPL.zip and MinGW.exe (if you don't have a MinGW with clang)
- Unzip them into the same folder
- Click C++ REPL.exe (Sometime config.txt need to be modified)
## Develop or Source Code Needed
- source.cpp will the the thing you need
